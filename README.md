CodeReview 4


Hello and welcome to my 4th CodeReview.


This one was particulary difficult for me as I had to deal with customising the main body with JS and I have had some difficulties the previous week with JS. 

I did however, after re-watching a bunch of times the live coding video, figure out a way to make it happen.

One thing that I did not manage to do, was to fix the likes buttons at the bottom of the cards on the right... instead they are at the bottom of the text, making some of them be a bit higher and some a bit lower. But they work properly. 

I basically followed Serris example in the video and kinda went with it. Before that though, I had tried several other approaches that would just not work for me in the end. I have commented them all out in the JS file. 

I added two more pages just for fun and and a Search Bar, just for the looks of it, since it doesn't really "search" for anything. 

The like increment works and when you click sort it will sort the movies by like, however, when you leave the page or refresh it they will go back to their initial value as set in the JSON file. 

I did try to save the value in the local storage and connect them through that, but I couldn't figure out how it works entirely so I just made it simpler.

Regarding the Tablet version... You will be able to see two instead of three cards on the screen at the breakpoint of 800 x 600. I only used Bootstrap for responsiveness and no media queries and this is what it gave me with the md... I tried other breakpoints but then it would also be two in large screens. 


Thank you for your time and have a nice rest of the weekend. 


Kind regards,
